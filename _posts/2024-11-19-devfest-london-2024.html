<p>I have attended DevFest events around the globeâ€Šâ€”â€Šfrom India to Sweden, Norway, and the UK. DevFest London was a standout experience this year, buzzing with the energy of 28 speakers, 4 tracks, and over 260 attendees.</p><figure><img alt="A close-up of the DevFest London 2024 attendee badge" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tb85qMzy3eBk4qfqo0aE1Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>A close-up of the DevFest London 2024 attendeeÂ badge</figcaption></figure><p>Having previously presented on cloud, data, AI platforms, and responsible AI in Stockholm and India, I was naturally drawn to the AI track. The sessions were a fascinating exploration of cutting-edge topics, rangingÂ from:</p><ul><li><strong>Generative AI model performance:</strong> A deep dive into the capabilities and limitations of todayâ€™s most advanced AIÂ models.</li><li><strong>Prompt injection attacks:</strong> A critical look at the security vulnerabilities of LLMs and how to mitigateÂ them.</li><li><strong>Avoiding common LLM pitfalls:</strong> Practical advice on navigating the challenges of working with large languageÂ models.</li><li><strong>The rise of LVMs:</strong> Insights into why Large Vision Models are poised to revolutionize how we interact with visualÂ data.</li><li><strong>Harnessing the power of Gemini:</strong> Expert tips on leveraging Googleâ€™s latest AI model while staying within ethical boundaries.</li><li><strong>AutoML with Vertex AI:</strong> Empowering business users to build and deploy machine learning models without coding expertise.</li><li><strong>Googleâ€™s Secure AI Framework (SAIF):</strong> A comprehensive overview of Googleâ€™s approach to building secure and trustworthy AIÂ systems.</li></ul><figure><img alt="Banner displaying the logos of companies sponsoring DevFest London 2024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*haDilQr_tmCOfu2HaD0udw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Banner displaying the logos of companies sponsoring DevFest LondonÂ 2024</figcaption></figure><p><strong>My DevFest secret weapon: </strong><a href="https://www.granola.ai/"><strong>granola.ai</strong></a></p><p>In the whirlwind of back-to-back sessions, I discovered a game-changer: <a href="https://www.granola.ai/"><strong>granola.ai</strong></a>. This incredible tool transcribed the sessions in real-time, allowing me to fully engage with the presentations without worrying about taking notes. If youâ€™re a meeting maestro juggling a packed schedule, <a href="https://www.granola.ai/">granola.ai</a> is your new bestÂ friend.</p><p><strong>Taking LLMs offline with Ollama and Open WebÂ UI</strong></p><p>One of the most exciting takeaways from DevFest was the potential of running LLMs locally. Tools like <strong>Ollama</strong> (<a href="https://ollama.com/">https://ollama.com/</a>) and <strong>Open Web UI</strong> (<a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/">https://docs.openwebui.com/</a>) make it surprisingly easy to experiment with LLMs on your machine, opening up a world of possibilities for privacy-preserving AI projects.</p><p><strong>More DevFest discoveries</strong></p><p>DevFest London also introduced me to some promising tools and platforms:</p><ul><li><strong>Codemagic:</strong> (<a href="https://codemagic.io/start/">https://codemagic.io/start/</a>) A CI/CD platform for mobile app development.</li><li><strong>Flutterflow:</strong> (<a href="https://www.flutterflow.io/">https://www.flutterflow.io/</a>) A low-code platform for building FlutterÂ apps.</li></ul><p><strong>My robotic endeavorÂ ðŸ˜‚</strong></p><p>I even attempted to build a robot! You can see the results in the GIFÂ below.</p><figure><img alt="This robot is coming to life, one Lego brick at a time" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*6HFOcVrsg4lBP9gGhtQYPw.gif" /><figcaption>This robot is coming to life, one Lego brick at aÂ time</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p><p>DevFest London 2024 was a whirlwind of AI innovation, insightful discussions, and inspiring connections. These passionate developers and forward-thinking companies are clearly shaping the future of technology. I canâ€™t wait to see what next yearâ€™s eventÂ holds.</p><figure><img alt="Great memories with fellow attendees at DevFest London 2024!" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FCWoqDvG2t8Cxsf6" /><figcaption>Great memories with fellow attendees at DevFest LondonÂ 2024!</figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=edbe51970066" width="1" height="1" alt="">
