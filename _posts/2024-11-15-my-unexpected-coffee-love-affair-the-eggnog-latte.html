<p>For years, I’ve travelled the world, exploring new cultures and cuisines, and sharing my experiences through my posts on Instagram. From bustling markets in India to Michelin-starred restaurants in Sweden, I’ve savoured a vast array of flavours. But one thing I’ve kept surprisingly quiet about is my love for coffee. It might seem mundane compared to my more exotic culinary adventures, but coffee has become an essential part of my daily ritual.</p><figure><img alt="The warmth of an eggnog latte brightened a chilly London afternoon." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NO1w7TF-3kXpghhdC_9--g.jpeg" /><figcaption>The warmth of an eggnog latte brightened a chilly London afternoon.</figcaption></figure><p>My coffee journey began with simple instant coffee lovingly prepared by my mother, a taste I preferred as a child. Over time, my preferences evolved, leading me to discover the bold flavours of Indian filter coffee and the comforting warmth of a European latte.</p><p>I’ve always been a creature of habit, frequenting the same cafes in each city I’ve lived in. But it was in London, with its vibrant cafe culture, that I truly expanded my coffee horizons. From cosy independent shops to bustling chains, I’ve become a regular at them all.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NpsDAWRnWFxy_bFHBgkAwA.jpeg" /><figcaption>A Parisian cafe latte</figcaption></figure><p>Which brings me to the star of today’s post: the <strong>Eggnog Latte</strong>. Now, I’ll admit, the concept of eggs in my coffee was initially a bit jarring. But curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to give this festive concoction a try.</p><h4><strong>A Brief History of Eggnog</strong></h4><p>Before we dive into the latte itself, let’s take a quick trip back in time. Eggnog, with its rich and creamy texture, has a surprisingly long history. It originated from a medieval British hot milk drink called “posset,” eventually making its way to the American colonies where it became a Christmas staple. Today, variations of eggnog are enjoyed globally, from “rompope” in Mexico to “coquito” in Puerto Rico.</p><figure><img alt="Sipping instant coffee amidst the cool air of the hill station" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wf6gMGxOtKTMuunAP451TQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Sipping instant coffee amidst the cool air of the hill station</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>What Exactly is Eggnog?</strong></h4><p>Essentially, eggnog is a decadent blend of milk, cream, sugar, eggs, and warming spices like nutmeg and cinnamon.
