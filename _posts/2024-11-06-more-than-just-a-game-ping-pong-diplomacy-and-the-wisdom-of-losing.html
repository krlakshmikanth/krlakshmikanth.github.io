<p>Ping pong, or table tennis as it’s formally known, has a surprisingly rich history. Born from Victorian England’s high society as an after-dinner amusement, it quickly evolved from improvised games with book “nets” and champagne-cork “balls” to a globally recognised sport. But beyond the paddles and the celluloid balls lies a fascinating tale of international relations — ping-pong diplomacy.</p><figure><img alt="A photo of a ping pong championship at the H&amp;M Group office in Stockholm in 2021" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p-j4OFGxFeyHyIAzzUKxNg.png" /><figcaption>A photo of a ping-pong championship at the H&amp;M Group office in Stockholm in 2021</figcaption></figure><p>This unlikely diplomatic tool emerged in the early 1970s, amidst the Cold War’s icy grip. An exchange of table tennis players between the US and China thawed the frozen tension, paving the way for President Nixon’s historic visit to China in 1972. Who knew that a seemingly simple game could hold such geopolitical power?</p><p>But ping-pong diplomacy is more than just a historical footnote. It speaks to the deeper human capacity for connection and understanding, even across seemingly insurmountable divides. And this is where Japan enters the story.</p><p>In his insightful TED Talk, Pico Iyer explores the unique philosophy surrounding ping pong in Japan. He observes a culture that fosters a competitive spirit without the cutthroat edge we often see in the West. It’s a subtle distinction, but one that reveals a profound wisdom: losing isn’t the opposite of winning; it’s failing to see the bigger picture.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fembed.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fpico_iyer_the_beauty_of_what_we_ll_never_know&amp;display_name=TED&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fpico_iyer_the_beauty_of_what_we_ll_never_know&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fpi.tedcdn.com%2Fr%2Ftalkstar-photos.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fb4e0ae64-7e9a-4aa3-ad5c-19d6c29d7b53%2FPicoIyer_2016T-embed.jpg%3Fh%3D316%26w%3D560&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=ted" width="560" height="316" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/2f9b181f613328e52002e49f665000be/href">https://medium.com/media/2f9b181f613328e52002e49f665000be/href</a></iframe><p>This resonated with me deeply. I’ve learned that true success lies not just in achieving victory, but in understanding the journey, the lessons learned, and the connections forged along the way.</p><p>Pico Iyer’s observations on ping-pong in Japan offer a valuable lesson for us all. In a world obsessed with winning, perhaps we need to embrace a new perspective. Perhaps, like the Japanese ping-pong players, we need to find the competitive spirit within ourselves, without losing sight of the shared humanity that connects us all.</p><figure><img alt="A festive scene of Stockholm’s Skansen market at Christmas time" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*evhtlXTN09niSp1gvZDEow.jpeg" /><figcaption>A festive scene of Stockholm’s Skansen market at Christmas time</figcaption></figure><p>So the next time you pick up a paddle, remember that ping-pong is more than just a game. It’s a microcosm of human interaction, a testament to the power of connection, and a reminder that sometimes, losing can be the greatest win of all.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b0ccb584ce5b" width="1" height="1" alt="">
