<p>One fine day, I started searching for a book related to Managerial effectiveness. I got too many options and finally thought of sticking to a book that I found very useful based on the index of the book. It had insights about the focus on result areas, performance standards, vital functions of management, building peak performers, hiring the right people and firing the incompetents. Finally, <a href="https://medium.com/u/a302a34a0740">Brian Tracy</a> book <a href="https://amzn.to/38MZ8qa">https://amzn.to/38MZ8qa</a> , gave me a holistic approach to deal with managerial effectiveness by making good decisions in ignoring meetings, becoming a role model to brainstorm solutions with clarity for achieving personal excellence.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/1*5gA6_JnLtKWyuHUoilpmKQ.png" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://bit.ly/38Xjnlp">https://bit.ly/38Xjnlp</a></figcaption></figure><p>Book Introduction as follows: The strength of any organization is determined by the quality of its managers. What they do and how they do it is the key determinant of corporate success. Want to become invaluable to your company? Boost your managerial skills. The good news is that great managers are made…not born.
