<p>It’s a habit of mine to share my thoughts on software engineering, real-world tech applications, and random musings on food, culture, and life experiences. Recently, I’ve dived deeper into podcasting, finding Spotify invaluable for distribution and Podcastle.ai a helpful tool for recording and post-production. I enjoy capturing insights from experienced individuals to share with others for their growth. To kick things off, I’ve collaborated with friends in the software industry to share their educational journeys, professional tips, and advice for early career professionals.</p><figure><img alt="Podcost Episode Cover Art" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-PF8V92wJ1ZcTJuj8IiW1g.png" /><figcaption>Episode Cover Art</figcaption></figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed%2Fepisode%2F5r3EbJSUs3UwbNYRVgpg06%3Futm_source%3Doembed&amp;display_name=Spotify&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F5r3EbJSUs3UwbNYRVgpg06&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2Fab67656300005f1f5e07eca04bfec1ce100a7c7c&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=spotify" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/d3730a02eda8b3f63fc43f2bda646db7/href">https://medium.com/media/d3730a02eda8b3f63fc43f2bda646db7/href</a></iframe><p>This episode focuses on Database Mastery.
