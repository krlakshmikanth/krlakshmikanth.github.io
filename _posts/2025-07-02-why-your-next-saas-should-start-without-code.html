<p>I stumbled across a YouTube video last month that completely flipped my thinking about building software products. The creator shared something that hit me like a cold shower: <strong><em>Never write code before securing paying customers. </em></strong>As someone who’s spent years building things nobody wanted, this felt personal.</p><figure><img alt="Stone cut 8th century Shore Temple, Mamallapuram, Chennai" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1lkZ4j7_hZgzp8qx" /><figcaption>Stone cut 8th century Shore Temple, Mamallapuram, Chennai</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what I learned about the micro-SaaS approach that actually works:</p><p><strong>Start with people, not products:</strong> Your first stop isn’t your code editor — it’s Reddit or find communities where your potential customers hang out. Join their conversations. Listen to their problems. Get them to sign up for something that doesn’t exist yet.</p><p><strong>Build a landing page first:</strong> Before you write a single line of code, create a simple page that explains your idea and collects email addresses. This becomes your validation tool and your first marketing asset.</p><p><strong>Ask for money upfront:</strong> Offer lifetime subscriptions to early supporters. If people won’t pay for a promise, they probably won’t pay for the product either.</p><figure><img alt="Karakattam:​ Ancient folk dance of Tamil Nadu" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZgQ7TTSXyCCGixKp" /><figcaption>Karakattam:​ Ancient folk dance of Tamil Nadu</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Embrace imperfection:</strong> Use AI tools and modern frameworks to ship fast. Your MVP doesn’t need to be perfect — it needs to solve a real problem for real people who’ve already paid you.</p><p><strong>Set a deadline:</strong> Give yourself three weeks. If you’re not generating revenue by then, move on. The market is telling you something important.</p><p><strong>Build only what’s requested:</strong> Create a roadmap, but resist the urge to build features nobody asked for. Let customer feedback drive your development priorities.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*APonO67wUjPe33mQ" /><figcaption>Green banana plant</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Keep the feedback loop tight:</strong> Make it ridiculously easy for customers to reach you. Their complaints and suggestions are more valuable than your assumptions.</p><p><strong>Understand the psychology:</strong> Study how people make buying decisions. The best product doesn’t always win — the best-marketed one does.</p><p>The most counterintuitive part? The less you build upfront, the more likely you are to build something people actually want.</p><p>What would you build differently if you knew someone was already willing to pay for it???</p><p><strong>Credits<br>- </strong>Images are taken from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash</a><br>- The video is in Tamil, but the strategy speaks every entrepreneur’s language.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_xDiUu0mWzw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_xDiUu0mWzw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_xDiUu0mWzw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/33b519e704600627973fe59efbc8e63d/href">https://medium.com/media/33b519e704600627973fe59efbc8e63d/href</a></iframe><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4df72613e28a" width="1" height="1" alt="">
