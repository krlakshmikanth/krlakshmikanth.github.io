<h3>Stockholm Cultural Night — A night to be remembered and cherished</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nvxIBOS0URoIfLZh-SjyrQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Stockholm Cultural Night at 23rd April 2022</figcaption></figure><p>The happening night for people who live in Stockholm. I am experiencing the cultural night at Stockholm for a first time and the weather played tricky at initial hours and was comfortable after times. I was accompanied by a young crowd and got an invitation from a friend of mine. We started with Swedish parliament visit but unfortunately we couldn’t get the guided tour since it’s super booked. The picture near the water in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helgeandsholmen">Helgeandsholmen</a> shows my excitement for the day.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/824/1*gPyVUHcB7Sqi8lwz3l9d0Q.png" /><figcaption>Lakshmikanth Rajamani’s picture near the Swedish parliament</figcaption></figure><p>It was windy and my friends started thinking about Belgium waffles and homemade ice creams. Unfortunately, my friends didn’t get the usual fruity Belgium waffles, so we went with <a href="https://stikkinikki.com/">Stikki Nikki</a> ice cream, it’s homemade and organic. It tasted great and I was fortunate enough to taste lemon-papaya combo, sunflower seeds with almond (vegan), and finally the regular one, milk and cookies. And we started walking towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Opera">Kungliga Opera</a> for a ballet performance.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8qiS9egWhuB6Vj10hYbzeA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Royal Swedish Opera</figcaption></figure><p>It was an awestruck experience with a live ballet performance. I know that it originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century but I haven’t got a chance to check out a live performance. I should honestly thank the Stockholm Cultural Night team for making this possible.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F703511609%3Fh%3Ddd92a343b1%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F703511609&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1421033077-147e86f5c6511568d71bacd88f938e9c89901f14623acd7f27827166d99d716d-d_640&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="720" height="1280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/e82a065dc16bc414a8d61125ef1126e3/href">https://medium.com/media/e82a065dc16bc414a8d61125ef1126e3/href</a></iframe><p>There were three ultimate performances lined up on that day, that was magical and romantic. Then we rushed to visit the vasa museet from Gamla Stan. Actually my friends wanted to take part in a haunted city walk event but we couldn’t find the location though google maps was working fine and apple maps too. We took an old tram to commute from T-Centralen to Vasa Museet and it was a special ride though, the tram was house-full and we were barely standing on our toes during the entire ride.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F703517370%3Fh%3D220164b22a%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F703517370&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1421043036-53107d80bed771aa56dd2e32a4cb07de3dcbfb38ad7cd8c1063e281780152b54-d_960&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1080" height="1920" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/9f70c065d0562338049c54e836029ff5/href">https://medium.com/media/9f70c065d0562338049c54e836029ff5/href</a></iframe><p>Here comes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_Museum">Vasa Museum</a>, located on the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djurg%C3%A5rden">Djurgården</a>. It displays the fully intact 17th-century ship that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628, and it’s the most visited museum in Scandinavia.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8w6737z29Dz7yZNJO3C0Og.jpeg" /><figcaption>VASA Museum</figcaption></figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F703511815%3Fh%3D46899ffaba%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F703511815&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1421033485-71407f2edbf16bdf24d2168ad0ea2faab4e35c2f28472fb3f47f48d1e34de43a-d_960&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1080" height="1920" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/534263137fa9391463ba3153723d2bf4/href">https://medium.com/media/534263137fa9391463ba3153723d2bf4/href</a></iframe><p>It was crowded not because the entry is free during the Stockholm cultural night but for its rich experience and craftsmanship. And I forget to mention that all the shows/ events and museum visits on 23rd April 2022 are free!</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F703511695%3Fh%3D7e7eefadb2%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F703511695&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1421033381-8fd021362253a26dbf8a6cd183895da6da14c6f7244c0a6514e1c639a6e453ca-d_960&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1080" height="1920" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/c782f73b5287dc5ab5825be04c003d1e/href">https://medium.com/media/c782f73b5287dc5ab5825be04c003d1e/href</a></iframe><p>We found a man standing in a lengthy wood with a fire in his hand, at the Vasa Museet entrance welcoming the audience during the Stockholm Cultural Night.<br>Here are some of the pictures from the Vasa museum that I found interesting based on the art and design work.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0d8PsmozE-X95h370ZmsQg.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A-BF19S_W50EbUlijDCIhA.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cRSOVXVEBTwgkrpzL2Zcmg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Pictures from the Vasa Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Later we had a chance to visit the Nordic Museum, located adjacent to the Vasa Museum. Nordic Museum is dedicated to cultural history of Sweden from the early modern period to the contemporary period. You can expect to experience the furniture, clothes and toys from the period mentioned above, also the sustainable earth and some interesting research on the ice and frozen creatures.</p><p>And interesting pictures from the Nordic Museum.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*foxHWGPQDqe6CgmmamXyMw.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*avLqSOfygdAcMn0JmGnKzA.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOLqRR_VAToYs-acN7hyIA.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vSXtiNf-teGon8SGgJ_sIQ.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DVr_FCrlsY6aF2TuqPtM4g.jpeg" /></figure><p>Somehow we managed to join the DJ night and enjoyed it to the core. I could see almost everyone dancing and expressing their happiness after a pandemic occurrence.</p><p>I danced for a long time and enjoyed myself with my friends during the Stockholm Cultural Night and I would recommend anyone to take part in Stockholm Cultural Night in the upcoming years if you’re planning to Sweden during that event.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-ZaYHzSjSy7E-W2hCbTHkA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Lakshmikanth and his friends at the Stockholm Cultural Night</figcaption></figure><p>It was perfectly organized and time-packed for a wide-audience group. One can explore dance, architecture, music, theatre, literature, and much more during this event. A big thanks to the city of Stockholm and the Culture Administration team for making it possible.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read about our experience with the Stockholm Cultural Night and the journey continues…</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F703511682%3Fh%3Db842fa755d%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F703511682&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1421033272-1fbc9342aa689df68d785367b45c1b559f6a5084f4b92352b56f8aed478dbbdb-d_960&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1080" height="1920" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/b3cd9321cddf6c825011a2bc17d9117b/href">https://medium.com/media/b3cd9321cddf6c825011a2bc17d9117b/href</a></iframe><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=69fb91d349db" width="1" height="1" alt="">
