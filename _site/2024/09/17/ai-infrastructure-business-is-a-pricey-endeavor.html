Iceberger Why starting an AI Infrastructure company now might be tough This section doesn’t discuss the basics of building infrastructure or AI systems. However, venturing into AI infrastructure right now might not be ideal. Here’s a realistic perspective based on experiences within the AI ecosystem: Limited Market for Niche Solutions: Imagine starting a business to support a single vendor needing custom infrastructure for on-premise LLMs. This approach might not attract many future customers. Challenges in a Competitive Landscape: The existing market is competitive. Convincing customers to move away from established cloud vendors with their comprehensive governance, platforms, and tight integration is difficult.

A startup might not be able to solve all their problems, as changes in strategy and new product adoption can trigger internal changes and unique challenges.Cost optimization in a cloud-native world: Helping cloud-native customers find their sweet spot for cost savings and system efficiency is a significant challenge.Idea protection: While intellectual property theft is a concern, established companies can quickly adapt and implement innovative ideas.
