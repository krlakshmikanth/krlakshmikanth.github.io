<meta name="description" content="As a curious individual, my journey in technology began in the 2010s thanks to student technology programs. Programs like Microsoft Student Partner, Github Education Program, and Google Student Ambassador were eye-opening experiences for me and my peers. During my time pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering at Anna University, through M. Kumarasamy College of Engineering in Karur, I had the freedom to engage in various tech programs and communities. This journey led me to inaugurate and build tech communities within the college. My involvement in multiple technology communities, starting with the Microsoft Student Program and the Google Developers Group Chapter in Coimbatore, introduced me to the world of open source and cloud engineering. I had opportunities to learn, experiment, build, and educate others on modern tech stacks. These experiences opened doors to internships at various organisations and participation in events organised by companies like Microsoft, Google, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, Dell, and others. A narrow, serene street in Stockholm with historic buildings and a distant church dome framed by autumn trees. Through my active participation in technical associations and communities, I gained valuable hard and soft skills. Some of the most important lessons learned include, Communication and Collaboration: Community involvement necessitates active participation in diverse activities. This includes marketing events, organising tech fests, coordinating with volunteers to conduct workshops and community-driven events, advocating for technology and tech-led products, securing sponsorships, and engaging in speaking opportunities at various forums and hackathons. Effective communication is crucial for clearly conveying ideas and ensuring successful execution. The collaboration further enhances workflows and outcomes. Decision Making: Every piece of information received or created presents an opportunity for decision-making. In tech communities, decisions are made daily, ranging from event planning, securing sponsorships, and successfully executing events to gathering feedback and making improvements. Delivering Value: The transformative nature of the tech industry requires communities to stay abreast of the latest releases and manage change effectively. This experience taught me valuable lessons in change management, future planning, risk mitigation, navigating challenges, and continuously updating my skills to achieve success. Program and Project Management: Being part of a community extends beyond simply delivering value; it involves learning about program management and tackling real-life problems to maintain momentum and inspire fellow students to participate in the tech world and foster innovation. This provided opportunities to learn project management using tools like Jira, Confluence for documentation, Trello, and Notion, all of which offer free versions for students. A crowd gathers beneath the famous Prague Astronomical Clock on a clear day, admiring the intricate details of the historic tower. Delegation: Understanding the nature of work and prioritising tasks based on importance and time sensitivity are essential for achieving optimal outcomes. Delegating tasks to fellow community members allows for skill development while enabling focus on critical tasks and enhancing overall productivity. Leadership: Effectively managing and leading communities requires strong leadership skills. A leader inspires fellow members through their work ethic and indirectly influences them to adopt their approach. Key leadership qualities include empathy, honest feedback, mentorship, leading by example, and providing support for task completion. Technology Toolbox: Like a mechanic’s toolbox, a technology toolbox is essential for success. This toolbox should include productivity tools, such as Microsoft Office or Google Workspace, as well as project and product management tools. Essential development tools include, but are not limited to, programming languages like Java, Python, React, JS, and other relevant frameworks. Low-code and no-code tools for business enthusiasts, design and graphics engineering tools for designers, testing tools for testing engineers, network and security tools, and cloud and AI technologies are also crucial for success. Technology companies often recognise the potential of the future workforce and offer free licenses and tools for students to build, test, and experiment with their products and services. Some of them are listed below, research on this topic to get more benefits. GitHub EducationGitHub - kamath/student-free-stuff: Just a list of free software dev tools students can getGitHub - AchoArnold/discount-for-student-dev: This is list of discounts on software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings for developers who are students These lessons learned from being a part of student tech communities have been invaluable in shaping my career and personal growth. I encourage all aspiring technologists to actively engage in these communities to foster their development and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology." />
