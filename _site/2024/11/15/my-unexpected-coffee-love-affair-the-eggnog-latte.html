<meta name="description" content="For years, I’ve travelled the world, exploring new cultures and cuisines, and sharing my experiences through my posts on Instagram. From bustling markets in India to Michelin-starred restaurants in Sweden, I’ve savoured a vast array of flavours. But one thing I’ve kept surprisingly quiet about is my love for coffee. It might seem mundane compared to my more exotic culinary adventures, but coffee has become an essential part of my daily ritual. The warmth of an eggnog latte brightened a chilly London afternoon. My coffee journey began with simple instant coffee lovingly prepared by my mother, a taste I preferred as a child. Over time, my preferences evolved, leading me to discover the bold flavours of Indian filter coffee and the comforting warmth of a European latte. I’ve always been a creature of habit, frequenting the same cafes in each city I’ve lived in. But it was in London, with its vibrant cafe culture, that I truly expanded my coffee horizons. From cosy independent shops to bustling chains, I’ve become a regular at them all. A Parisian cafe latte Which brings me to the star of today’s post: the Eggnog Latte. Now, I’ll admit, the concept of eggs in my coffee was initially a bit jarring. But curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to give this festive concoction a try. A Brief History of Eggnog Before we dive into the latte itself, let’s take a quick trip back in time. Eggnog, with its rich and creamy texture, has a surprisingly long history. It originated from a medieval British hot milk drink called “posset,” eventually making its way to the American colonies where it became a Christmas staple. Today, variations of eggnog are enjoyed globally, from “rompope” in Mexico to “coquito” in Puerto Rico. Sipping instant coffee amidst the cool air of the hill station What Exactly is Eggnog? Essentially, eggnog is a decadent blend of milk, cream, sugar, eggs, and warming spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. Often, a splash of alcohol like rum, brandy, or bourbon is added for an extra layer of festive cheer. Making Eggnog from Scratch If you’re feeling adventurous, here’s a simplified version of how this holiday treat is made: Infuse the milk: Gently heat milk with spices like cinnamon and cloves.Create the base: Whisk egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy.Temper the eggs: Gradually add the warm milk to the egg yolks, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.Thicken the mixture: Cook over low heat until it reaches a custard-like consistency.Chill: Allow the eggnog to cool completely.Add alcohol (optional): Stir in your preferred spirit.Lighten it up (optional): Fold in whipped egg whites for extra airiness. Important Notes: Safety first: Always use pasteurized eggs to avoid any risk of salmonella.Variety is the spice of life: Experiment with different spices, alcohol, and flavourings to create your perfect eggnog.Store it right: Homemade eggnog can be kept in the fridge for several days. The taste of Chennai: filter coffee, flawlessly brewed Whether you’re a seasoned coffee lover or just looking to try something new, the eggnog latte is a delicious way to embrace the holiday spirit. So go ahead, treat yourself to this festive indulgence — you won’t regret it!" />
