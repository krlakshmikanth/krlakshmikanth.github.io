<meta name="description" content="I have attended DevFest events around the globeâ€Šâ€”â€Šfrom India to Sweden, Norway, and the UK. DevFest London was a standout experience this year, buzzing with the energy of 28 speakers, 4 tracks, and over 260 attendees. A close-up of the DevFest London 2024 attendeeÂ badge Having previously presented on cloud, data, AI platforms, and responsible AI in Stockholm and India, I was naturally drawn to the AI track. The sessions were a fascinating exploration of cutting-edge topics, rangingÂ from: Generative AI model performance: A deep dive into the capabilities and limitations of todayâ€™s most advanced AIÂ models.Prompt injection attacks: A critical look at the security vulnerabilities of LLMs and how to mitigateÂ them.Avoiding common LLM pitfalls: Practical advice on navigating the challenges of working with large languageÂ models.The rise of LVMs: Insights into why Large Vision Models are poised to revolutionize how we interact with visualÂ data.Harnessing the power of Gemini: Expert tips on leveraging Googleâ€™s latest AI model while staying within ethical boundaries.AutoML with Vertex AI: Empowering business users to build and deploy machine learning models without coding expertise.Googleâ€™s Secure AI Framework (SAIF): A comprehensive overview of Googleâ€™s approach to building secure and trustworthy AIÂ systems. Banner displaying the logos of companies sponsoring DevFest LondonÂ 2024 My DevFest secret weapon: granola.ai In the whirlwind of back-to-back sessions, I discovered a game-changer: granola.ai. This incredible tool transcribed the sessions in real-time, allowing me to fully engage with the presentations without worrying about taking notes. If youâ€™re a meeting maestro juggling a packed schedule, granola.ai is your new bestÂ friend. Taking LLMs offline with Ollama and Open WebÂ UI One of the most exciting takeaways from DevFest was the potential of running LLMs locally. Tools like Ollama (https://ollama.com/) and Open Web UI (https://docs.openwebui.com/) make it surprisingly easy to experiment with LLMs on your machine, opening up a world of possibilities for privacy-preserving AI projects. More DevFest discoveries DevFest London also introduced me to some promising tools and platforms: Codemagic: (https://codemagic.io/start/) A CI/CD platform for mobile app development.Flutterflow: (https://www.flutterflow.io/) A low-code platform for building FlutterÂ apps. My robotic endeavorÂ ðŸ˜‚ I even attempted to build a robot! You can see the results in the GIFÂ below. This robot is coming to life, one Lego brick at aÂ time Final thoughts DevFest London 2024 was a whirlwind of AI innovation, insightful discussions, and inspiring connections. These passionate developers and forward-thinking companies are clearly shaping the future of technology. I canâ€™t wait to see what next yearâ€™s eventÂ holds. Great memories with fellow attendees at DevFest LondonÂ 2024!" />
