<meta name="description" content="I got a chance to visit the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad campus for Data Science Summit 2019. It started with ensuring my identity when entering the campus. The campus was so magnificent and green, I would able to see peacocks walking on the pavements of the ISB. I took a couple of pictures and entered the building. I found a stationery store, ISB store which sells t-shirts, shirts, water bottles, coffee mugs and other products which had ISB branding, and a canteen. I had a great tea time with my friends from Hyderabad, where I got a chance to interact with Data Science professionals across the industry, which ranges from the chemical industry to the retail giant, Amazon. I was invited to this summit by Prashanth Mohan Sangem. We both work for the same company and manage different product teams that are responsible for delivering automated AI solutions. Followed by technological talks from Industry people and discussion panel was hosted by in-house professors from ISB. To be honest, I felt like, I had lunch at a three-star property and I loved Hyderabadi food which I ever tasted in my life before. Again, we had a great time discussing products that are available in the market to solve Data Science needs and its challenges. Interacted with teaching assistants from ISB and also had a chance to meet big brains from Amazon, TCS, Capgemini, Microsoft, Jio, Google and startups. Capgemini was the title sponsor for the event and we had a couple of speakers from the same organization. Everyone’s attention was, ‘How Enterprises will start to think about the data and its hidden importance to grow and understand their business opportunities’, We had brainstorming sessions with people from Healthcare, Fintech, Security and Computational Operations. I enjoyed the variety of keynote speakers and panel discussions. I loved that many of the technology company representatives present were asking questions of Data Science about how the companies could most effectively create change. isb_video.mp4 The overall tone of the event allowed participants of different backgrounds, knowledge and experience levels to participate equally. It was an awesome experience at ISB’s Data Science Summit 2019 and I wish to attend their upcoming summits as well." />
