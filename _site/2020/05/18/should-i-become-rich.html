<meta name="description" content="It’s about a book — “How to attract Money” It’s an excellent piece by Dr. Joseph Murphy. After reading the book, I feel like I need to praise or appreciate the author cause I really got impressed by his views of comparing life in a nutshell. He tries to educate everyone who reads his book that you have the right to be rich! https://medium.com/media/8429dce0577507df3143abaefbf85bc2/href He will help you to find the hidden powers within yourself to attract money. He mentions that Wealth and poverty have their origins in the mind. The basic message of the book is that wealth must be created inwardly(internal pieces of stuff) first then it applies in the real world and as the result of the Law of Attraction. My favorite sentences in the book were, https://medium.com/media/987665ff966e6efb5d4b05b0f5d519c0/href Draw nigh into it, and it will draw nigh into you Meaning: When you come closer to something you want/need, then it’ll become/come closer to you She changed water into wine It’s all about the divine wisdom and love that you get within yourself. Which in turn it applies to the external world. The most liked word in the book was the automaton (a moving mechanical device made in imitation of a human being) — it’s related to Artificial Intelligence. I wonder that AI is part of everyone’s life to get things done easier never before. https://medium.com/media/b3a01b765aa93be9bf6d35a4a7a231b2/href Changing the fear to faith and accepting my goodness is what I happened from the book, How to attract Money I would recommend people to be conscious of health to get wealth. Infinite Intelligence reaches when your mind is at rest and the body is feeling the warmth, sound, and the peace that resists in the earth. Practice yoga and meditate daily to become super-rich and to become a magnet to the money. If you like to buy the book from Amazon, Please find the link https://amzn.to/3bI6ZGT https://medium.com/media/1f6b6858666ce6f7f2403cb31c19e421/href thanks for reading my thoughts, and it’ll be continued!" />
