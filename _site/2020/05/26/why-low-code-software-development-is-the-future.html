Low-Code development describes a family of tools used to create a complete application visually, using a drag-and-drop interface rather than writing thousands of lines of complex code. Even business users and the IT department can collaborate to build applications with modern user interfaces, data integrations, workflows, and business logic, to deliver business results in blazing fast speed https://medium.com/media/5d1b332804c81d230ab6e8ee6df50d84/href Things that you can build with low-code development Internal Application People can unlock additional value from the existing systems and data through new mobile and web interfaces which helps business improvise their processes, efficiency, security with standard encryption templates across the enterprises Customer-facing application User interface and User experience are some of the keys to attract new customers for any business. In this era, every business wants to create a digital customer experience by introducing a design immersive front-end UI that reinforces the brands. Responsive design, progressive web apps, accelerated mobile pages, on and offline data availability, scalability, usability, and security plays an important role while developing a customer-facing application and this requirement as satisfied by low-code development within making integration with device capabilities or third-party products.

Building software with low-code is the same as building software any other way. Unless you’re writing everything from scratch in machine code — and, no, assembly language doesn’t count — then you’re already taking shortcuts built on the work of others With low-code, it’s all about the things you don’t have to do. Rather than hand-coding yet another user management system, dealing with the idiosyncrasies of the latest programming framework, or writing ten tests before a single line of your app’s code, you get straight to creating something new and valuable. Why start new when these problems have already been solved and the patterns are well understood? https://medium.com/media/4e14759c0638d54738c4bb8a7223c2e0/href The Low-Code Development Process With Low-Code it would look more like this: Low-Code Development Seven steps instead of sixteen Low-code understands that most of the time spent hand-writing code on the web and mobile apps are pretty much wheel spinning. There’s no need to tread the same path each time we start a new project. Low-code lets us create applications visually using battle-tested fundamentals.

The line between the two is not sharp. However, there are a number of key differences: App Creator No-code platforms are accessible to any end-business user while low-code platforms require professional developers who can work within the platform’s constraints Core Design No-code platforms tend to function off a model-driven, declarative approach where the end-user dictates an app’s design through drag and drop manipulation or simple expressions. Low-code platforms depend more on hard code to specify an application’s core architecture User Interface No-code platforms most often rely on a preset user interface layer which simplifies and streamlines an app’s design. Low-code platforms may provide greater flexibility in UI options at the cost of additional coding and complexity requirements https://medium.com/media/04595608f9a29d1e134cfe84710bb5d3/href Low-Code is about getting more done Ultimately, low-code is a way for developers to get more done. With low-code, you spend more time creating and building and less time on repetitive work. Sure, it’s fun to learn the latest faddish JavaScript framework or play with a cutting-edge NoSQL data store, but while you’re spending time debugging unfamiliar code, your competitor has an MVP in front of customers Low-code isn’t about reducing the value of developers. Low-code lets teams of developers produce more value more quickly while drawing on their understanding of how to create and maintain high-quality web and mobile applications https://medium.com/media/271cdbea050385e88766ca2bd15c5e2d/href Criticism Some IT professionals question whether low-code development platforms are suitable for large-scale and mission-critical enterprise applicationsOthers have questioned whether these platforms actually make development cheaper or easierAdditionally, some CIOs have expressed concern that adopting low-code development platforms internally could lead to an increase in unsupported applications References https://www.outsystems.com/blog/what-is-low-code.htmlhttps://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platformshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platformhttps://giphy.com" />

Unless you’re writing everything from scratch in machine code — and, no, assembly language doesn’t count — then you’re already taking shortcuts built on the work of others</p><p>With low-code, it’s all about the things you don’t have to do. Rather than hand-coding yet another user management system, dealing with the idiosyncrasies of the latest programming framework, or writing ten tests before a single line of your app’s code, you get straight to creating something new and valuable. Why start new when these problems have already been solved and the patterns are well understood?</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FIdHYuMKwEi59bOhZ4X%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FIdHYuMKwEi59bOhZ4X%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FIdHYuMKwEi59bOhZ4X%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy" width="435" height="362" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/4e14759c0638d54738c4bb8a7223c2e0/href">https://medium.com/media/4e14759c0638d54738c4bb8a7223c2e0/href</a></iframe><h3>The Low-Code Development Process</h3><p>With Low-Code it would look more like this:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/0*KpgjcYKjN6H7VWtT" /><figcaption>Low-Code Development</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Seven steps instead of sixteen</strong></h3><p>Low-code understands that most of the time spent hand-writing code on the web and mobile apps are pretty much wheel spinning. There’s no need to tread the same path each time we start a new project. Low-code lets us create applications visually using battle-tested fundamentals. Our focus becomes delivering something valuable to the world</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FhSoqdBi5aTHZ4QFdtT%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FhSoqdBi5aTHZ4QFdtT%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FhSoqdBi5aTHZ4QFdtT%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy" width="435" height="362" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/46bbdb6513f90fd4656dc931a15cf75a/href">https://medium.com/media/46bbdb6513f90fd4656dc931a15cf75a/href</a></iframe><h3>Low-Code Vs No-Code</h3><p>No-code development platforms are similar to low-code development platforms but require no coding at all. The line between the two is not sharp. However, there are a number of key differences:</p><h3><strong>App Creator</strong></h3><p>No-code platforms are accessible to any end-business user while low-code platforms require professional developers who can work within the platform’s constraints</p><h3><strong>Core Design</strong></h3><p>No-code platforms tend to function off a model-driven, declarative approach where the end-user dictates an app’s design through drag and drop manipulation or simple expressions. Low-code platforms depend more on hard code to specify an application’s core architecture</p><h3><strong>User Interface</strong></h3><p>No-code platforms most often rely on a preset user interface layer which simplifies and streamlines an app’s design. Low-code platforms may provide greater flexibility in UI options at the cost of additional coding and complexity requirements</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FMCQt327h55QljDJjjT%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FMCQt327h55QljDJjjT%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FMCQt327h55QljDJjjT%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy" width="435" height="362" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/04595608f9a29d1e134cfe84710bb5d3/href">https://medium.com/media/04595608f9a29d1e134cfe84710bb5d3/href</a></iframe><h3>Low-Code is about getting more done</h3><p>Ultimately,<strong> low-code is a way for developers to get more done</strong>. With low-code, you spend more time creating and building and less time on repetitive work. Sure, it’s fun to learn the latest faddish JavaScript framework or play with a cutting-edge NoSQL data store, but while you’re spending time debugging unfamiliar code, your competitor has an MVP in front of customers</p><p>Low-code isn’t about reducing the value of developers. Low-code lets teams of developers<strong> produce more value more quickly while drawing on their understanding of how to create and maintain high-quality web and mobile applications</strong></p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FlRRbllkPt2Xq8txcl6%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;display_name=Giphy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FlRRbllkPt2Xq8txcl6%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FlRRbllkPt2Xq8txcl6%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy" width="435" height="362" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/271cdbea050385e88766ca2bd15c5e2d/href">https://medium.com/media/271cdbea050385e88766ca2bd15c5e2d/href</a></iframe><h3>Criticism</h3><ol><li>Some IT professionals question whether low-code development platforms are suitable for large-scale and mission-critical enterprise applications</li><li>Others have questioned whether these platforms actually make development cheaper or easier</li><li>Additionally, some CIOs have expressed concern that adopting low-code development platforms internally could lead to an increase in unsupported applications</li></ol><h3><strong>References</strong></h3><ol><li><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/what-is-low-code.html">https://www.outsystems.com/blog/what-is-low-code.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platforms/">https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platforms</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform</a></li><li><a href="https://giphy.com/">https://giphy.com</a></li></ol><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a4dba71a90c" width="1" height="1" alt="">
